# # Print the length of the list.
# print(len(some_nums))

# # Use antoher python built-in function and print the result.
# print(some_nums.index(3))

# # Remove an item from the list. Remember to verify that it was removed.
# some_nums.pop()
# print(some_nums)

# Utilize a method from the documentation and print the result.
